# Data Description and Assessment

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies and only has data up to the year 2016. This dataset was found on Kaggle and the link is https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales. According to the description it was generated by scraping the data from the VGChartz website. This dataset contains 11 columns which are:

- Rank - Ranking of overall sales
- Name - The game's name
- Platform - Platform of the game's release
- Year - Year of the game's release
- Genre - Genre of the game
- Publisher - Publisher of the game
- NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
- EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions)

I was able to analyze this dataset to find information related to the video game industry such as finding the most popular/best-selling genres and platforms. I was also able to narrow down the data by region to get a closer look at regional differences in the video game industry. I also identified how publishers used this data to maximize their profits and how they focused solely on genres and platforms that were proven to be highly profitable.

### - Structure/Shape of the data:

Rectangular

Qualitative (categorical) - Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, and Publisher

Quantitative (numerical) - NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales and Global_Sales

### - The granularity of the data:

A fine level of granularity since each data point represents a single video game.

### - Scope and completeness of the data:

The scope of the data is large since the dataset contains sales information for many different regions.

### - Temporality of the data:

The data is from 1980-2016 (There are only 3 items in the year 2017 so these will be removed).

### - Faithfulness of the data

This dataset was last updated in 2016 so there won't be any way to see how the trends have changed since the creation of this dataset. Some rows are missing data in the Year and Publisher columns and some contain duplicate information. There are also some errors with the years because the max value in the year column is 2020 which is incorrect since there can only be years from 1980-2016.

# Cleaning the data

### 1. Load and check the data frame:

Loaded the data using pd.read_csv and created a data frame called vgsales. Then I used .describe() and .describe(include = "O") to check for any rows with missing values. I noticed that some rows had their Year and Publisher columns with missing values.

### 2. Remove NaN Values:

Used .isna() to check and remove NaN values from Year and Publisher columns and created a new data frame called vgsales2 without those NaN values.

### 3. Remove rows with invalid years:

Removed rows that had years after 2016 since there weren't enough rows to bother including data after 2016.

### 4. Remove duplicates:

Removed rows that had the same name, platform, and year.

### 5. Check datatypes:

Changed the datatype of Year from float64 to int64.

After cleaning the data we go from 16,598 rows to 16,286 rows.

# Single variable distribution plot

From the visualization we can see the platform with the most games (with sales greater than 100,000 copies) is the DS and PS2. 

These are two platforms where games are much cheaper to make and are two platforms that had a much longer lifespan of games being released compared to other platforms.

From this visualization, we can see the top genres and how many games belong in that category. 

The action genre is number one and has more than 3000 games (with sales greater than 100,000 copies) in the dataset. This may be why so many publishers choose that genre when creating a game because it has proven to be successful in making a profit.

This visualization shows the total amount of games each publisher has made (with sales greater than 100,000 copies). 

Electronic Arts is the publisher with the most games in this dataset and they tend to develop games yearly that are a part of the top 2 genres (action and sports) that have been proven to be successful at making a profit.

This visualization shows the count of games with sales greater than 100,000 copies over the years.

From this graph, we can see as the gaming industry grew more popular so did the profits. For example, we can see that in the '90s there were fewer than 500 games that sold more than 100,000 copies while in the 2010s there were over 2500 games that sold more than 100,000 copies.

# Multiple variable plots

From what we can see overall North America has the most sales compared to Europe, Japan, and Other regions. But all four seem to have a big increase and then a sudden drop. I wonder what is the cause of this drop in sales.

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/EwrpkdK.png)

Since we already know that Electronic Arts has published the most games it is surprising to see that it doesn't hold the number one spot of most sales. Maybe their games don't really sell that many copies compared to Nintendo which holds the number one spot.

# Model 1: Decision Tree

The first prediction model I used was the decision tree model with max depths of 3, 10, and 20. I created dummy variables for the genre column. I created an x data frame containing only the year and genre columns. I also created a y data frame containing only the global sales columns. The data was split into training and testing data which was used to get the mean squared error for both training and testing for each max depth.

max_depth = 03  
MSE test: 0.882705934443137  
MSE train: 0.07185287613771285

max_depth = 10  
MSE test: 0.5633199009670071  
MSE train: 7.351989767353041e-07

max_depth = 20  
MSE test: 0.5616361571516266  
MSE train: 7.7100464418941e-32

# Model 2: Linear Regression

The second prediction model that I used was Linear Regression. I used independent variables publisher, year, and genre. The dependent variable was global sales. I also used the scaled version of the publisher column where I chose publishers who met a certain threshold. The model that had the best R-squared value was the 3rd one with a value of 0.084 which is the closest to 1. I also graphed the residuals of all 3 models. I would probably pick the last model since it had the best R-squared value and the p-values seem to be good.

I would probably use the linear regression model over the decision tree model since we seem to get more information from that model when it comes to the global sales of video games.

# Sales Distribution By Region and Genre Using Heatmap

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/kzTKtDN.png)

So I created a heat map that displays the sales distribution for each region according to the genre of the game. This allows you to see which genre has sold the most in all the different regions. So according to this heat map for North America, Europe, and Other the best-selling genre is the Action genre. But for Japan the best-selling genre is Role-Playing. Another thing to notice is that the Strategy genre seems to be the genre with the least sales for all the regions. So if you were a publisher looking into making a video game and were located in North America the number one genre you should put your focus on is creating an action video game.

# Sales Distribution By Genre Using Lineplot

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/yCsd9Bi.png)

So this time I created a line plot that displays the sales distribution for all regions according to the genre of the game. From what we can see in this line plot the top three genres are Action, Sports, and Shooter. So no matter the region you choose to publish your game those three genres should take priority in order to get the most sales. Those three are the safest choices to make when deciding the genre of the game. But despite Strategy being the genre with the least sales doesn't mean you shouldn't make any effort to make games in that genre because its sales are still good enough to be in the top 12. But it also makes sense why publishers mainly focus on games that are a part of the top three genres since they are safe bets with a good guarantee of making some good money.
