# Data Description and Assessment

The dataset that I'm using is the Video Games Sales dataset that was created by GregorySmith which hasn't been updated in a while which means it only has data up until 2016. You can find this dataset on Kaggle and the link to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales. This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. According to the description it was generated by scraping the data from the VGChartz website. This dataset contains 11 columns which are:

- Rank - Ranking of overall sales
- Name - The game's name
- Platform - Platform of the game's release
- Year - Year of the game's release
- Genre - Genre of the game
- Publisher - Publisher of the game
- NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)
- EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions)

The reason why I'm interested in this dataset is because we can analyze this data to find information related to video games such as finding out the most popular genre or platform. We can also narrow down the data by region to get a closer look at regional differences in video games. We can probably solve many problems such as how to decide on what video game genre a publisher should focus on creating to maximize their profits and many other questions someone may have related to video games.

### - Structure/Shape of the data:

Rectangular

Qualitative - Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre and Publisher

Quantitative - NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales and Global_Sales

### - The granularity of the data:

A fine level of granularity - Each row represents a single video game

### - Scope and completeness of the data:

I'd say that the scope of this data is pretty big since we have a large amount of video game data to choose from and we can narrow it down in many ways.

### - Temporality of the data:

The data is from 1980 to 2016 (There are only 3 items in the year 2017 so I will be removing those).

### - Faithfulness of the data

This dataset was last updated in 2016 so there won't be any way to see how the trends of this data have changed since the creation of this dataset. I tried looking for a more current dataset and many of them lacked information that was present in this dataset or there were too many errors to clean up compared to this dataset. There are a few games that are missing data in the Year and Publisher columns. There also seem to be duplicate games with the same name but I have to make sure if the rows themselves are actually the same because it could be a case of the same game being released on a different platform. There also seem to be some errors with the years because the max value in the year column is 2020 which doesn't make sense because there should only be years from 1980-2016.

# Cleaning the data

### 1. Load and check dataframe:

Loaded the data using pd.read_csv and created a dataframe called vgsales. Then I used .describe() and .describe(include = "O") to check for any columns with missing values. I noticed that Year and Publisher were missing values inside of them.

### 2. Remove NaN Values:

Used .isna() to check and remove NaN values from Year and Publisher columns and created a new dataframe called vgsales2 without those NaN values.

### 3. Remove rows with incorrect years:

Removed rows that had years that were greater than 2016 since there weren't enough rows to bother including data after 2016.

### 4. Remove duplicates:

Removed games that had two entries with the same Name, Platform, and Year. Besides that, there weren’t any more duplicates.

### 5. Check datatypes:

Changed the datatype of Year from float64 to int64.

From what we can see the platform with the most games is the DS. Which is a handheld platform where the games are probably much cheaper to make compared to other platforms so it would kinda make sense why there are so many games on that platform.

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/Tc7F4AC.png)

We can see that Action is the number one genre, the Sports genre is second, and the Misc genre is third. The Misc genre was probably used to combine genres together or maybe for games that didn't have genre when the data scraping was done on the VGChartz website.

Electronic Arts is the publisher with the most games tied to them in this dataset. It would be interesting to see how their games are divided up in terms of genre and platform.

It isn't surprising to see that in the 1980s-2000s there weren’t as many games released compared to later years since the industry pretty much just started at that point in time.

# Multiple variable plots

From what we can see overall North America has the most sales compared to Europe, Japan, and Other regions. But all four seem to have a big increase and then a sudden drop. I wonder what is the cause of this drop in sales.

Since we already know that Electronic Arts has published the most games it is surprising to see that it doesn't hold the number one spot of most sales. Maybe their games don't really sell that many copies compared to Nintendo which holds the number one spot.

# Model 1: Decision Tree

The first prediction model I used was the decision tree model with max depths of 3, 10, and 20. I created dummy variables for the genre column. I created an x data frame containing only the year and genre columns. I also created a y data frame containing only the global sales columns. The data was split into training and testing data which was used to get the mean squared error for both training and testing for each max depth.

max_depth = 03  
MSE test: 0.882705934443137  
MSE train: 0.07185287613771285

max_depth = 10  
MSE test: 0.5633199009670071  
MSE train: 7.351989767353041e-07

max_depth = 20  
MSE test: 0.5616361571516266  
MSE train: 7.7100464418941e-32

# Model 2: Linear Regression

The second prediction model that I used was Linear Regression. I used independent variables publisher, year, and genre. The dependent variable was global sales. I also used the scaled version of the publisher column where I chose publishers who met a certain threshold. The model that had the best R-squared value was the 3rd one with a value of 0.084 which is the closest to 1. I also graphed the residuals of all 3 models. I would probably pick the last model since it had the best R-squared value and the p-values seem to be good.

I would probably use the linear regression model over the decision tree model since we seem to get more information from that model when it comes to the global sales of video games.

# Sales Distribution By Region and Genre Using Heatmap

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/kzTKtDN.png)

So I created a heat map that displays the sales distribution for each region according to the genre of the game. This allows you to see which genre has sold the most in all the different regions. So according to this heat map for North America, Europe, and Other the best-selling genre is the Action genre. But for Japan the best-selling genre is Role-Playing. Another thing to notice is that the Strategy genre seems to be the genre with the least sales for all the regions. So if you were a publisher looking into making a video game and were located in North America the number one genre you should put your focus on is creating an action video game.

# Sales Distribution By Genre Using Lineplot

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/yCsd9Bi.png)

So this time I created a line plot that displays the sales distribution for all regions according to the genre of the game. From what we can see in this line plot the top three genres are Action, Sports, and Shooter. So no matter the region you choose to publish your game those three genres should take priority in order to get the most sales. Those three are the safest choices to make when deciding the genre of the game. But despite Strategy being the genre with the least sales doesn't mean you shouldn't make any effort to make games in that genre because its sales are still good enough to be in the top 12. But it also makes sense why publishers mainly focus on games that are a part of the top three genres since they are safe bets with a good guarantee of making some good money.
